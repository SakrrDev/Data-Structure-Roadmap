# Project_1: Student Management System using BST
I recommend trying this project after you finish studying BST. 
It's a small project to test out what you learned about Binary Search Trees (BST). 
Each student is a node in the BST, and their Student ID is the key. 
You'll practice basic BST stuff like Insert, Delete, Search, and Traversals.

## Features

1. **Add Student**: Put a new student in the BST using their ID.
2. **Delete Student**: Remove a student by their ID.
3. **Search Student**: Find a student and see their info using ID.
4. **Show All Students**: List all students sorted by ID (Inorder Traversal).
5. **Find Min/Max ID**: See the student with the smallest or biggest ID.

# Project_2: Simple Inventory System using BST
I also recommend trying a small inventory project. 
Each item in a store is a node in the BST, with Item ID as the key. 
You can practice Insert, Delete, Search, and show all items sorted by ID.

## Features

1. **Add Item**: Insert a new item with ID, name, and quantity.
2. **Delete Item**: Remove an item using its ID.
3. **Search Item**: Find an item and see its details.
4. **Show All Items**: Display all items sorted by ID.
5. **Find Min/Max ID**: Show the item with smallest or biggest ID.
